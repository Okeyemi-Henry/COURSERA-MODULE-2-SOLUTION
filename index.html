          </div>
          <p>
           Chickens were domesticated about 8000 years ago and are omnivores, meaning they will catch and eat insects, lizards, toad and even field mice. There are more chickens on earth than people – 25 billion – with backyard chicken keeping becoming increasingly popular in urban and suburban areas.</p>

          <h3>Beef</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
  The United States and Australia are the top beef producing countries in the
world.
More than 100 medicines used by humans come from beef cattle.
One cowhide can produce enough leather to make 20 footballs, 18 soccer balls,
18 volleyballs, or 12 basketballs.
Among the 50 states, Kansas is number 1 in beef processing and number 3 in
beef production.
Cattle are ruminant animals. They have a stomach with four compartments,
which allows them to eat feeds like grass and hay which humans cannot eat.
When the average beef cow chews feed it causes over 40,000 jaw movements
per day.
Cattle consume less than 2/1

        <h3>Sushi</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        “Is sushi Japanese?” is one of the common sushi-related questions often asked online. And before you roll your eyes and say duh, let me quickly say that unlike what most of us think, Japan is not the birthplace of sushi.

While Japan is no doubt the sushi capital of the world, we have Southeast Asia and China to thank for inspiring modern sushi. The practice of making sushi is estimated to have started as early as 500 B.C. in the rice-growing region of Southeast Asia, somewhere along the Mekong River. </p>
